I won't hesitate to diss one, Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this, Some drop science, while I'm dropping English, Even if Yella, makes it a-capella, I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess, Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage, And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing, But making a sucker and you equal, Don't be another sequel (Express yourself!), Now, getting back to the PG, That's program, and it's easy, Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow, Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow, The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin, Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end, Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help, There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself, It's crazy to see people be, What society wants them to be, but not me, Ruthless, is the way to go, they know, Others say rhymes which fail to be original, Or they kill where the hip-hop starts, Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts, Some musicians cuss at home, But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone, Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none, They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction, Some say no to drugs, and take a stand, But after the show, they go looking for the \"Dopemann\", Or they ban my group from the radio, Hear N.W.A. and say, \"Hell no!\", But you know it ain't all about wealth, As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!), from the heart, Cause if you want to start to move up the chart, Then expression is a big part of it, You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift, Movin like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis, There's a little bit more to show, I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo, Or a lesson, all of 'em expression, And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wessun for ya, I might ignore your record because it has no bottom, I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn, It's Dre on the mic, getting physical, Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob!, Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this, And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus, Or a tumor, but here is the rumor, Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good, When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it, Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage, Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket, I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it, So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic, Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight, Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health, But I won't strike if you just (Express yourself!)",
